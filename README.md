## Raw data

The data used for prediction is the public anonymized transactional data from Raiffeisenbank. It is stored in the archive `data/raw/raiffeisen_data_anonymized.csv.zip`.

## Further pipeline

All procedures are executed in the corresponding jupyter-notebooks (directory `pipeline/`) in the order suggested by their corresponding names (i.e. `pipeline/1_data-preprocessing.ipynb`).
